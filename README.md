### LibtorrentPHP 1.0.0-dev
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CentricWebEstate/LibtorrentPHP.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/CentricWebEstate/LibtorrentPHP)

LibtorrentPHP is a project based on the awesome work by @tcz. It provides a strictly modular and feature complete implementation of the BitTorrent protocol. LibtorrentPHP differs from its upstream parent PHPTracker in that it is more modular and has the goal of being able to be implemented into other open source projects. LibtorrentPHP will endeavour to provide upstream pull requests where applicable and possible.

### Warning!

The master branch of this project is the remnant of the old PHPTracker v0.3 release. The develop branch where all the work is occurring is current in a state of massive flux and not suitable for use in anything in its current state.
